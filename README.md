# COVID-19 in China
In April 2020, [**Ravi Prakash**](https://raviprakashravi.cf/) has published a research paper, entitled [**Predicting the Rate of Growth of the Novel Corona Virus 2020**](https://www.researchtrend.net/ijet/current_issue_ijet.php?taxonomy-id=77), through _International Journal on Emerging Technologies (IJET)_ i.e. indexed by Scopus. It is a data-science research work. <br />
_(the paper can either be downloaded from the journal's website by clicking above at it's title or by clicking_ [_here_](https://github.com/ravi-prakash1907/COVID-19-China/edit/master/publication/)_)_ <br /><br />

This repository is based on a data-science based research work, where I have given a mathematical model to estimate the growth rate of the novel Coronavirus in China. <br />
Here the status of the cases in mainland of China within 7-8 days from March 21<sup>st</sup> are predicted. <br />
In this work, we have also varified, the steps taken by the Chianese government as well as how accurate we analysed the things, with our estimates. <br /><br />

### Scope
It basically works on the linear regressions. The data used in this reasearch is collected from various sources inscuding _**Johns Hopkins University**_ and _**Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Government of India)**_. A similar approach can also be used to understand and slightly predict the rate of growth of the COVID-19 in any region of the world.
